# SimpleNLG German
SimpleNLG is a simple Java API designed to facilitate the generation of Natural Language. It was originally developed by Ehud Reiter, Professor at the [University of Aberdeen's Department of Computing Science](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/index.php) and co-founder of [Arria NLG](https://www.arria.com). This is an adaption of [SimpleNGL V4.4.8](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg) to German.

As the authors of the original, English SimpleNLG library state, "SimpleNLG is intended to function as a ["realisation engine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_(linguistics)) for [Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation) architectures [...]".

## Current Release (German)
The current release of SimpleNLG-DE is V1.1.1.
